![It's never late, to improve yourself a bit.](/assets/img/about-hero.png)

## Welcome.

My name is **Arthur Frank**, I am full stack engineer since 2008.
This blog is my little space to share my experience & knowledge in coding and tech leadership.

Apart from my main interests mentioned above, I am huge fan of photography and psychology.

I truly believe that your skills and knowledge are the only single important thing you can invest your time and resources in. This is the real thing which defines who you are, and what you can achieve in life and no one can take it off you.

In this blog you will find information about things like:
  * **JavaScript**
  * **Web development**
  * **HTML**
  * **CSS**
  * **OOP**
  * Programming **Design Patterns**
  * **Application Architecture**
  * JavaScript frameworks - **Vue**, **React** etc.
  * **Leadership**
  * **Psychology** in **tech**
  * **Project management**
  * **Agile**, **SCRUM** and all that jazz
  * How to smash documentation
  * **Version Control** with tools like **Git**
  * Testing - **Unit, functional tests**, automation with tools like  **Nightwatch** etc.
  
  And Many more. Enjoy your time here. ðŸ”¥
